# dontTouchThisApp
My first web app that use the mouseOver and mouseOut event handler that change the data on the page.

Please make sure that you install `node.js` on your computer and then use `npm install` on your command prompt
or terminal to install node into this folder. Then you use `npm start` to start a webpage of my app.
